## Install
```
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("r-glennie/openpopscr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
The package requires you have a C compiler installed on your system. Windows users may need to install R-tools for this reason. It is assumed Linux and Mac users have a compiler installed. 


## Help 
A vignette describing how to use the package is included: 
```
library(openpopscr)

```
